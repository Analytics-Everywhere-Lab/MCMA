It is the open-source code for MCMA, which could reconstruct 12-lead ECG with arbitrary single-lead ECG. If possible, please cite "Multi-Channel Masked Autoencoder and Comprehensive Evaluations for Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from Arbitrary Single-Lead ECG"
It includes demo.py, the trained model, and sample data.
You can reproduce it:conda env create -f environment.yml
